### Motivation

The goal of the joint effort is to automate the important field work that
epidemiologists perform when they try to trace who may be a vector for the
virus, and who may be in danger. To achieve that goal, the effort will enlist
the voluntary data collection efforts of anyone with a smartphone.

Superficially this appears to be similar to other smartphone crowd-sourcing
apps, but underneath the covers is a brand new approach, one that guarantees
anonymity and complete user control over their data.

In a nutshell, it works like this. When two people with contact tracing
smartphones come in close proximity to each other, they seamlessly exchange
information about the encounter via Bluetooth technology. Later when someone is
diagnosed with the virus, their heath care provider, with the consent of the
patient, releases that information, and anyone who has come in contact with the
patient in the past two week is alerted to the fact. Potentially exposed people
may then take proactive steps to get tested and self-isolate.
